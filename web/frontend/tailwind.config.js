 * Tailwind build config: compiles only the utility classes actually used by

 * used to compile styles in the browser at runtime).
 *
 * Rebuild with ./build-tailwind.sh whenever classes change in index.html,
 * partials/ or the JS sources. app.js is deliberately not scanned: it is
 * generated from src/, and minifier output changes would otherwise churn
 * tailwind.css even when no class was added or removed.
